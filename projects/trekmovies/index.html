      <p>Hello, my name is Cynthia, and I'm going to talk a little bit about how I feel about the
      Star Trek movies.  Not all of them, just the first six ones that featured the actors from
      the original series.</p>

      <p>I was 11 in 1982 when I saw my first Star Trek.  It was the second movie, The Wrath of Khan,
      and I was in love with it right away.  I'd always been (up to that point) a fan of space and
      of science fiction.  I read tons of stuff from Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke,
      and other SF authors of their day.  I'll be damned if I can remember any of that stuff now,
      but I was big into it back in the day.</p>
      
      <p>When I saw this wonderful movie that combined the setting of outer space, a human civilization
      that can travel in it. and the look and feel of the ships and uniforms, that was it.  I was
      hooked.</p>
      
      <p>So, my experience of getting to know Star Trek in the 80s was that a movie would come out every
      couple of years, and to me that was what was "currently" happening with the characters, but I could
      also watch the original series in reruns once a week, which I saw as backstory about those guys.
      I liked that too, but less so because I didn't like the visual presentation quite as much.  Those
      burgundy uniforms really did it for me!</p>
      
      <p>In this article, I'm going to write a little bit about each of the six movies in turn.  How I
      felt about it when I first saw it, what place it settled into over time as far in the sense of, "I 
      am <em>this</em> much into this bit of pop culture.  And I'm going to talk a bit about how I feel
      about them today, at age 50, and knowing more now about actual space as opposed to SF space, as
      well as some of the usual Star Trek nitpicky things.</p>
      
      <p>Let's dive in!</p>
      
      </section> <!-- intro -->
      
      <section id="Star_Trek:_The_Motion_Picture" class="std-style main-section">

      <p>I considered changing the order that I discuss these movies here to something other than the
      order they came out.  Reverse order, possibly, or the order in which I saw them, of which this
      is the only one that's out of place.  I think I saw them like, 2,3,1,4,5,6, but anyway.</p>
      
      <p>I didn't want to discuss this one first because I hated it.  Some of the others the shine came
      off them after a few years, but this one was just no good for me right away.</p>
      
      <p>Some of the "lowlights" of this movie:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>If Vulcans are so unemotional, why did the priestess or whatever let Spock's "Amulet
        of Indifference", or whatever the thing is called, slide out her hand and onto the ground,
        in so obviously contemptuous a manner?</li>
        <br><li>Did they hire an actual actor to play the Klingon captain, or did they just get the 
        parking lot attendant to do it or something?</li>
        <br><li>The uniforms are ridiculous.</li>
        <br><li>Kirk and Scotty in the shuttle.  They're trying to make it look like you're looking 
        through the windshield at them, but they couldn't pull off that shot in those days, so
        the perspective is all wrong.  It looks like the shuttle has a TV mounted on the front or
        something.</li>
        <br><li>Kirk really is being an unreasonable dink here.  He obviously doesn't know the rebuilt
        ship as well as the new guy, and he gives him heck for countermanding orders that would have
        destroyed it!</li>
 
      </ul>
      
        
      <figure class="std-style" style="width:var(--inset-size); text-align:center; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">

        <figcaption>What the hell is this?</figcaption>
      </figure>
       
      <p>Those are all the specific nitpicks I can recall from that movie offhand, and I'll be 
      damned if I'm going to sit through that stinker again just to name some more.  The thing is,
      Star Trek: The Motion Picture is, and it's hard to overstate this, incredibly <em><strong>
      BORING!</em></strong>  It's not fun, it's not engaging, it's not particularly dramatic,
      it's just some 90 minutes of Kirk and Spock being dinks to people followed by some of the
      typical new age crap of the era with the guy from "Touched By an Angel" and a bald woman.</p>
 
      
      <p>If I recall correctly, anyway.  It certainly was BORING, so it's not like I'm gonna go back and do
      any research here.</p>
      
      <p>It's safe to say that if this was the first Star Trek thing I'd even seen, I would never
      have been into Star Trek at all.  I never would have given it another chance; I would have 
      refused to watch it.</p>
      
      <p>Happily, the first Star Trek thing I saw was...</p>

      <p>Now, <em>this</em> was much better!  For me, having been born two years after the moon landing,
      and now being 11 years old and having been interested in science and space always up to that point,
      <em>this</em> was the stuff I wanted to see!  Also, as I mentioned previously, those burgundy
      uniforms were really sharp!</p>
      
     
      
      <figure class="std-style" style="width:var(--inset-size); text-align:center; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">

        <figcaption>These guys got this!</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <p>Thinking about that movie now though, I have some nitpicks about it, and I think with some of
      it, it would have meant that I wouldn't be much into it if I were seeing it for the first time
      today.</p>
      
      <p>One is actually with the scene in the picture above.  Are they totally mocking Saavik or
      something?  First off, Spock tells her to take the ship out, and then Kirk's acting all nervous
      like she's going to crash it into the dock or something.  Why?  Because she's a girl?  And,
      on top of that, it turns out that she's not even going to drive anyway, she just sits in a
      different chair and tells <s>George Takei</s> Sulu to drive it out.  What the hell with all that?</p>
      
      <figure class="std-style" style="width:var(--inset-size); text-align:center; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
        <img src="images/twok2.jpg" style="width:var(--inset-size);">
        <figcaption>Or not.</figcaption>
      </figure>
          
      <p><em>This</em> scene makes it looks like they should have just let her run the whole show in the
      first place.  During the tense scene while we're waiting for Khan to attack, Saavik speaks up and
      starts to say that according to the rulebook they're supposed to do something in this situation,
      probably something defensive like raise the shields.  Well, Kirk doesn't do that, probably again
      because girl, and Spock actually tells her to shut up!</p>
      
      <p>For me. those two guys didn't look very good coming off of that.</p>
 
       <figure class="std-style" style="width:var(--inset-size); text-align:center; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
        <img src="images/chekov1.jpg" style="width:var(--inset-size);">
        <figcaption>Ceti Alpha..7?  6?  5?  How many was there supposed to be?</figcaption>
      </figure> 
      
      <p>And I'm sorry, but this guy really needs to get fired.  This guy was the <em>navigator</em>
      on the <em>Enterprise</em>, and when he goes back to this place, he doesn't notice that there's
      a planet missing?  (That's actually a pick all by itself - planets don't <em>blow up</em>!)  That there's
      a new asteroid belt?  That the missing planet is the one they were going to?  That the one they
      actually <em>did</em> go to is the wrong distance from the star?</p>
      
      <p>It lost them a ship, and got people on another one killed.  Plus we never even heard what
      happened to the crew of the <em>Reliant</em>.  I have to think there was some music for Kirk
      and Chekov to face when they got back, and Spock too if he wasn't dead at the time.</p>

      <p>But anyway, he <em>was</em> dead, so we have this movie.</p>
      
      <p>When Search for Spock came out, I'd been eagerly watching the original series as much as I
      could, and seen about half of it by this time.  I liked the characters enough to do that, but
      what I was really interested in was what would happen with them in the current era.</p>
      
      <p>I was reading a lot of Trek fan publications in those days, or any information I could get
      about Trek, and I knew that there was this assumption that the next movie would bring Spock
      back to life, and I wanted that as much as any fan did.</p>

        <figcaption>I find it distinctly agreeable myself.</figcaption>
      </figure> 
      
      <p>When I first saw the movie, I was <em>very</em> happy with it.  There was an arc to this
      story!  Things were changing.  Spock was back, but that was where the familiarity of the new
      situation ended.  They were fugitives!  The <em>Enterprise</em> was gone!  They had a
      <em>Klingon</em> ship now, of all things, and who knew what was gonna happen!</p>
      
      
      <p>I thought they were going to wind up being a space version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_A-Team">
      The A Team</a>, going around the galaxy fixing messy situations for the better, always one step ahead of the
      law.  It was going to be so cool!</p>
 
       <p>Not to mention that Genesis was still a thing.  Sure, it didn't work for it's <em>
      intended</em> purpose, creating a new livable planet, but it would still do the thing that
      the <em>Klingons</em> still both feared and coveted: It would destroy an existing planet
      surface along with any people or infrastructure that already existed there.  I'd been
      awaiting with great interest to see how that part of the story played out.</p>

      </div>     
      
      
      <p>I'll begin by saying I found it to be a very enjoyable movie.  It was definitely fun.  For
      me, the "Enterprise guys in our time" stories always are.  Or close to our time.  "City on
      the Edge of Forever" counts.  But they're always fun, and this movie was no exception.</p>
      
      <p>I found the idea that the great galactic hero James T. Kirk, who had survived hostile aliens,
      megalomaniac computers, capricious gods, and all manner of other stuff, almost got taken out
      by a <em>car</em> of all things, to be absolutely hilarous!</p>
      
      <figure class="std-style" style="width:var(--inset-size); text-align:center; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
        <img src="images/tvh1.jpg" style="width:var(--inset-size);">
        <figcaption>Did you guys see that?  Was that Khan?  It was, wasn't it?
        KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNN!!!!!</figcaption>
      </figure>    
      
      <p>The first part the movie, before they go into the past, made a good start on pushing forward
      with the Genesis drama that'd I'd been anticipating as well.  The Klingons were <em>not</em>
      going to sit still for this superweapon crap, and they had a point, too!</p>
      
      <p>About the part of the movie before the trip, you notice how Spock totally disses Saavik
      again?  Here this woman had <em>sex</em> with him in the previous movie because he would die
      otherwise.  Sounds like bullshit to me, but she believes it.  And look what kind of respect
      and regard she gets for that!</p>

        <figcaption>I must go feed my cat, Lieutenant.</figcaption>
      </figure>    
      
      <p>Exactly why does she like him again?  It was never really clear.</p>
      
      <p>I found the ending of the movie disappointing in that it restored conditions essentially to
      normal.  Instead of having the characters or setting or anything change naturally based on
      the events of the story so far, the only difference from the normal state for these guys
      was that there was now an "A" appended to the registry number of their ship.</p>

      </div> 
          
      <p>Which this movie did nothing to fix.</p>
      
      <p>I enjoyed the movie well enough, I suppose.  It was the familiar characters in a modern
      setting, and I liked it, but I was <em>very</em> disappointed that the whole Genesis thing
      was just dropped.  Even with it only being useful as a weapon, Genesis should have been
      a total game changer for the story as regards powers unfriendly to our heroes, like the 
      Klingons.  Great groundwork for that laid by the prior two movies, and then just
      abandoned.</p>
      
      <p>By this time it was apparent also that there were going to be few if any more movies
      with the original cast, so there wasn't going to be room for any arc development after this.
      By this time, Star Trek: The Next Generation had already been out for a while, and set in
      a time decades ahead of what we were seeing in the movies, so it was pretty clear that 
      arc development in the movie era was pretty well done with.</p>
      
      <p>About the actual movie itself, I haven't got much to say.  It was basically an episode.
      A reasonably entertaining episode, but an episode.  After the action it put everything
      back the way it was, ready to use again next week.</p>

      <p>Well, ok.  I'll say this.  Of all these movies it's the only one where they're doing
      what their mission statement says: Exploring the unknown.  It takes a guy hijacking their
      ship to make it happen, but there they are!</p>

      </div>  
           
      <p>Well, any idea that there might be story arc or continuity with this set of movies was
      done now, because it was well known that this was going to be the last one.</p>
 
      <p>It's actually the only Star Trek movie that I paid to have available in the cloud.  I watched
      it once since I did that.  (It's the only movie of any kind that I paid to have in the cloud.
      I'm not really a movie person.)</p>
           
      <p>My major pick at this movie is that <em>THEY'RE NOT NEARLY MAD ENOUGH AT SPOCK!</em>
      
      <figure class="std-style" style="width:var(--inset-size); text-align:center; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
        <img src="images/tuc1.jpg" style="width:var(--inset-size);">
        <figcaption>I am not interested in retiring, so the rest of you can forget
        it as well.</figcaption>
      </figure> 
                
      <p>It's actually a pretty big deal.  It's not hard to figure out from the movie dialog to this
      point that these guys are basically retired <em>already</em>.  McCoy is finding out for the first time that Sulu
      is the captain of another ship now.  We could normally attribute that to exposition, but we
      don't need the exposition about that because we've seen Sulu on his ship in the movie already.
      Not only that, but Sulu said in that scene that he's been at it for <em>three years</em>.</p>
      
      <p>So if McCoy doesn't know that, it means it's been <em>that long</em> since the guys from
      the <em>Enterprise</em> have worked together.  It sounds like they've individually moved
      on already, but there's some sort of understanding that they're still on call for starship
      duty only so they can get enough time in for their pensions or something.  They're not
      expecting to actually get called up.</p>
      
      <p>And along comes Spock, who not only got them a mission, but one they're mostly against
      as well!</p>
      
      <p>I would have thought they'd <em>all</em> have something to say to him about that, not just
      Kirk.</p>
      
      <p>But anyway, apparently they just get over it and off they go.  It was a good, entertaining 
      movie.  I liked that there was an extended bit with Spock in charge of the ship while Kirk
      was off somewhere else, which was frequently the case in the old show.

        <figcaption>Try this!  It's from a legendary place in the far reaches of

      <p>It's also the only Star Trek I've seen that features the characters smoking a joint.</p>

        cat?</figcaption>
      </figure> 
      
      <p>I <em>really</em> liked Kim Cattrall as Valeris in this movie.  Enough that if it weren't
      the last movie of the series, I would have been pissed that she turned out to be a bad guy.
      She would have been a great new recurring character or even a regular.</p>
      
      <p>But, that's what I had to say about Saavik too, and that's whether we're talking about
      Robin Curtis <em>or</em> Kirstie Alley.  It being that Undiscovered Country <em>was</em>
      the last movie of the series, I'm glad they didn't just put Saavik in that spot and have her
      be the villian.  They did that character bad enough already, having her just be there for
      the first bit of Voyage Home and then never seen again.</p>
      
      <p>All in all though I found Undiscovered Country to be a fun movie and a nice finale for
      this set of characters.

      <p>My disappointment at the abandonment of the Genesis storyline and other elements that 
      suggested an evolving setting from that era notwithstanding, it was a fun series of movies.  There's a reason
      I'm still interested in talking about them when the last of them came out 30 years ago.</p>
      
      <p>Story elements that suggested the present setting evolving, like the introduction of new
      characters, the blowing up of the original ship, and the introduction of the Excelsior were
      promising as far as I was concerned, but the reality probably is that those new elements
      had more to do with contract negotiations with recalitrant actors than anything else.  Paramount
      wanted to keep this property with it's modest but reliable payoff going.</p>
      
      <p>But Star Trek: The Next Generation put an end to any need to do that in the latter-day
      original series setting of the movies, so that was the end of that.</p>
      
      <p>For myself personally, I find it hard to enjoy shows that are based on the premise of
      interstellar travel now, because it's pretty apparent now that's not going to happen.
      I'm just not able to suspend my disbelief enough to enjoy something like that now.  For me,
      an engaging and believable story arc that develops over time has to be found elsewhere than
      in science fiction.</p>
