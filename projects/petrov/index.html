    <div class="tribute-header">So what's the big deal anyway?</div>
    <p>In 1983, Stanislav Petrov saved the lives of most, if not all, of the people who were
    living at that time, as well as ensured that there would be a world and a civilization worth
    living in.</p>
    
    <div class="tribute-header">Who is Stanislav Petrov?</div>
   <p>Sadly, it's now <em>was.</em>  Who <em>was</em> Stanislav Petrov, because in May of 2017, 
   the man passed away.<p>
   
   <p>Petrov was a lieutenant colonel in the 
   Air Defense Forces of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union
   </a>, at the height of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War">Cold War</a>
   era, during which those of us who were alive at the time lived with the knowledge that
   the Cold War might go hot at any moment, and we would be blown to bits, incinerated,
   vaporized, or worse, to survive long enough to die a slow excruciating death in the
   world of radioactive soot and fallout that would exist after a nuclear exchange.</p>
   
   <div class="tribute-header">Background</div>
   <p>Petrov was born near Vladivostok in the South Eastern Soviet Union on September 7, 1939.
   The context for this is that his birth was days after the beginning of World War II in 
   Europe, and not quite two years before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa">
   the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union</a>.  This would have meant that the war was an over-arching theme in Petrov's early
   life, and that the need for national defense would have been something that was strongly
   ingrained in him from an early age owing to the events around him and in the world in that 
   day and age.</p>

   <div class="tribute-header">What actually happened?</div>
   <p>In 1983, Petrov was on overnight duty at a facility for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oko">
   Oko</a> missile defense program.</p>
   <p>One night, when Petrov was on duty, the system indicated that the US had launched a missile at
   the Soviet Union, followed shortly by as many as five others.  This was shortly after the Soviets had shot 
   down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Air_Lines_Flight_007">a civilian aircraft 
   from South Korea</a>, so Cold War tensions were running particularly high at that time.</p>
   Petrov's job was not to actually launch the counterattack himself, it was to pass the 
   computer-generated warning up the chain of command and let his superiors determine what to do about
   it.</p>
   
   <div class="tribute-header">It was never about defense.</div>
   <p>There was no actual defending against the missiles the system had detected.  "Raise the shields"
   and "fire the anti-missile lasers" weren't among the options that Petrov's superiors would have had
   if Petrov had reported the warning.  It was either launch the Soviet missiles and obliterate the 
   US as well, or don't do that.  Those were the options.</p>
   
   <div class="tribute-header">Anyway, he didn't report the warning.</div>
   <p>Petrov didn't report the warning.  He was an IT guy; he knew how these systems worked
   and what types of flaws they might be subject to.  He said after the incident that there
   were dozens of other warnings that a real launch should have triggered before the one he
   saw, and that the warning was suspect based on that.  Also, his training was that a US
   first strike would be all-out, involving hundreds or thousands of missiles, not five.</p>
   
   <div class="tribute-header">That's why we're still here</div>
   <p>It's because one man used his judgement instead of just following the rules or doing 
   what the computer said.</p>
   <p>We maybe tend to forget about it a bit today, in 2021, but the Cold War was <em>nothing
   to laugh about.</em>  I was 12 years old in 1983.  I was aware of the Cold War, I followed 
   news about it, and I knew about events related to it.  I remember the Korean aircraft that
   the Soviets had shot down, and the news coverage that made it sound like we'd all but had
   it.  The arsenals of the two countries were measured in how many times over
   they could wipe out life on Earth. Those were scary days.</p>
   Which tells me that young Stanislav Petrov, who grew up in World War II and the immediate
   aftermath, including the start of the Cold War, had a keen awareness of the situation 
   for his country and the world from an early age
   as well.</p>
   
   <div class="tribute-header">He wasn't sure</div>
   <p>Years after the incident, after he'd retired from the military and the Soviet Union was 
   dissolved anyway, Petrov said in an interview that he had actually not been <em>sure</em> at
   all that the launch wasn't real.</p>
   
   <p>When it was time to decide, to report or not report, Stanislav Petrov made the decision 
   that he would <em>not</em> pass warning up to his superiors, who then would assuredly have 
   launched the Soviet arsenal as well, killing millions in North America or perhaps even 
   literally everyone.</p>
   
   <p>This even though it was a very real possibility that in a few minutes the missiles would
   hit his own country.  When faced with an atrocity or even <em>genocide</em> inflicted on his own
   people, Stanislav Petrov saw that his only options were to make it worse or to not make
   it worse, and he chose not to.  We are alive today because of that.</p>
   
   <p>That's who Stanislav Petrov was.</p>
